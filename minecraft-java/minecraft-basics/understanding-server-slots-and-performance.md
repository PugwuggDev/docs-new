# Understanding Server Slots and Performance

Understanding server slots and performance is crucial for running a successful Minecraft server. At HostByte, we use the **Game Panel** to help you monitor and optimize your server's performance. This guide explains how slots work and how to get the best performance from your server. ⛏️

***

### ⚙️ What are Server Slots?

Server slots represent the maximum number of players that can connect to your server simultaneously. Think of them as "seats" at your server table:

* ➡️ **1 Slot** = 1 player can join
* ➡️ **10 Slots** = Up to 10 players can join at once
* ➡️ **50 Slots** = Up to 50 players can join at once

***

### ⚡ How Slots Affect Performance

Each player slot requires resources from your server:

* ✔️ **RAM Usage** - Each player needs memory for their data
* ✔️ **CPU Processing** - More players = more calculations
* ✔️ **Network Bandwidth** - Data transfer for each connection
* ✔️ **Storage I/O** - Reading/writing world data

***

### ⚙️ Recommended Slots by Plan

Here's how many slots we recommend for different server plans:

| **Plan**     | **RAM**   | **Recommended Slots** | **Best For**                              |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Dirt         | 1GB       | 2-5 players           | Basic testing only - very limited         |
| Grass        | 2GB       | 5-10 players          | Minimal vanilla servers - no plugins      |
| Copper       | 3GB       | 8-15 players          | Basic servers with few plugins            |
| Iron         | 4GB       | 10-25 players         | Small communities - limited plugins       |
| Gold         | 6GB       | 15-35 players         | Growing servers - moderate plugins        |
| Diamond      | 8GB       | 25-50 players         | Popular servers - heavy plugins           |
| Emerald      | 12GB      | 35-75 players         | Major communities - modpacks              |
| Dragon Egg   | 16GB      | 50-100 players        | Professional networks - heavy modpacks    |
| Ender Dragon | Unmetered | 100+ players          | Enterprise networks - unlimited potential |

**⚠️ Note for Modded Servers:** Modded servers require significantly more RAM than vanilla servers. For modded servers, we recommend:

* ⚠️ **Light Modpacks** (20-50 mods) - Add 2-4GB to recommended RAM
* ⚠️ **Medium Modpacks** (50-150 mods) - Add 4-8GB to recommended RAM
* ⚠️ **Heavy Modpacks** (150+ mods) - Add 8-16GB to recommended RAM
* ⚠️ **Kitchen Sink Packs** - Consider Diamond plan (8GB) minimum

**Example:** A vanilla server with 10 players might work on Iron (4GB), but a modded server with 10 players would need at least Gold (6GB) or Diamond (8GB) for optimal performance.

### ⚙️ Monitoring Performance in Game Panel

Your HostByte Game Panel provides real-time performance monitoring:

* ✔️ **Live Resource Usage** - See RAM, CPU, and storage in real-time
* ✔️ **Player Count** - Track how many players are online
* ✔️ **Server Status** - Monitor uptime and response times
* ✔️ **Console Logs** - View performance-related messages

***

### ⚙️ Optimizing Server Performance

To get the best performance from your server:

1. ➡️ **Choose the Right Plan** - Match RAM to your expected player count
2. ➡️ **Use Optimized Software** - Paper/Spigot for better performance
3. ➡️ **Limit Plugins** - Only install necessary plugins
4. ➡️ **Regular Restarts** - Clear memory and optimize performance
5. ➡️ **Monitor Resource Usage** - Keep an eye on RAM and CPU usage

***

### ⚠️ Performance Warning Signs

Watch for these signs that your server needs more resources:

* ⚠️ **High TPS (Ticks Per Second) Drop** - Server lag
* ⚠️ **Players Getting Kicked** - Memory issues
* ⚠️ **Slow World Loading** - Storage or RAM problems
* ⚠️ **Console Errors** - Resource exhaustion
* ⚠️ **High CPU Usage** - Server struggling to keep up

***

### ⚙️ Understanding TPS (Ticks Per Second)

TPS is a key performance metric:

* ✔️ **20 TPS** = Perfect performance (normal game speed)
* ✔️ **15-19 TPS** = Good performance (slight lag)
* ✔️ **10-14 TPS** = Poor performance (noticeable lag)
* ✔️ **Below 10 TPS** = Very poor performance (severe lag)
