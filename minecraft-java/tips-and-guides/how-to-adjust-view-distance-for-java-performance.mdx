title: "How to adjust view distance for Java performance"
description: "Lowering your server’s view-distance and simulation-distance can greatly improve performance (TPS) by loading and ticking fewer chunks. This guide shows where to change these settings for Vanilla/Paper/Spigot and how to pick good values."
---

## What These Settings Do

- **view-distance** — How many chunk rings are _sent to players_ (what they can see). Affects bandwidth and memory.
- **simulation-distance** — How many chunk rings are _actively ticked_ (mobs AI, redstone, farms). Affects CPU the most.

_Tip:_ Reducing **simulation-distance** usually gives the biggest lag reduction on survival servers with farms.

## Before You Start

- **Back up** your server (optional but recommended).
- Tell players you’re adjusting performance settings; it may change how far they can see or how farms behave at range.

## Step 1: Stop Your Server

1. Log in to the [<u>HostByte Game Panel</u>](https://game.hostbyte.net/).
2. Open your **Java** server and click **Stop** until it shows _Offline_.

## Step 2: Edit `server.properties` (All Java Servers)

1. Go to **File Manager** → open `server.properties`.
2. Find or add the lines and set your values, for example:

   ```
   view-distance=8
   simulation-distance=6
   
   ```
3. Click **Save**.

     style={{ width:"22%" }}

   />

<img
  src="/images/69_simulation-distance.png"
  alt="69 Simulation Distance Pn"
  title="69 Simulation Distance Pn"
  style={{ width:"22%" }}
  className="mr-auto"
/>

  **Notes:**\
• `simulation-distance` exists on modern versions. If missing on older versions, only `view-distance` is available.\
• Lower numbers = fewer chunks = better performance, but players see/tick less.

## Step 3 (Optional): Paper/Spigot Per-World Settings

Paper and Spigot let you fine-tune or override per world.

### Paper

- **Defaults file:** `paper-world-defaults.yml` (global defaults)
- **Per-world file:** `world/paper-world.yml` (and for Nether/End)

Look for keys like `view-distance` and `simulation-distance` in those files to override the server.properties values per world.

### Spigot (Legacy/Older)

- **File:** `spigot.yml` → `world-settings` → `default` or the specific world

Older Spigot versions exposed `view-distance` per-world here. On newer versions, prefer `server.properties` and your platform’s docs.

## Step 4: Start & Test

1. Return to the dashboard and click **Start**.
2. Join the server and confirm chunks load as expected.
3. Monitor **TPS** with timings or a profiler plugin (e.g., _spark_).

## Recommended Starting Values

- **Small servers / survival SMP:** `view-distance=8`, `simulation-distance=6`
- **Mid-size / events:** `view-distance=10`, `simulation-distance=8`
- **Performance under load:** try `6 / 4`, then raise gradually

Increase slowly and observe TPS. Values below `4` simulation may affect some farm mechanics at range.

## Common Issues & Fixes

### “No change after restart”

- Ensure you edited the correct `server.properties` for this server.
- Paper/Spigot per-world files can override. Check `paper-world*.yml` or `spigot.yml`.

### Players complain they can’t see as far

- Raise `view-distance` a little; keep `simulation-distance` conservative for TPS.

### Farms stop when players move away

- Increase `simulation-distance` modestly or keep players closer to the farms.

## Best Practices

- Change one value at a time and test during peak hours.
- Favor lowering `simulation-distance` first for CPU relief.
- Document your final settings for staff and future updates.
