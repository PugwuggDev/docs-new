title: "Best view-distance and simulation-distance for Java"
description: "Choosing the right view-distance and simulation-distance is the fastest way to improve performance on a Minecraft Java server. This guide gives practical, field-tested defaults for different server types and shows how to set and fine-tune them on Paper/Spigot using the HostByte Game Panel."
---

## Quick Recommendations

- **Small Survival SMP (≤ 15 players):** `view-distance=8`, `simulation-distance=6`
- **Mid/Busy Survival (15–40 players):** `view-distance=8–10`, `simulation-distance=5–6`
- **Events / Large Servers (40+ players):** `view-distance=6–8`, `simulation-distance=4–5`
- **Mini-games / Lobby:** `view-distance=6–8`, `simulation-distance=4`
- **Creative Build Server:** `view-distance=10–12`, `simulation-distance=6` (raise cautiously)
- **Modded (Forge/Fabric) / Heavy Redstone:** start `view-distance=8`, `simulation-distance=4–6` then tune

**⚠️ Tip:** Lowering _simulation-distance_ cuts CPU load the most (mob AI, redstone, farms). Lower _view-distance_ to reduce network/memory usage and exploration lag.

## What Each Setting Affects

- **view-distance** — How many chunk rings are _sent_ to players (visibility). Impacts memory and bandwidth.
- **simulation-distance** — How many chunk rings are _ticked_ (mob AI, crops, redstone). Impacts CPU the most.

## How to Set These Values

1. Log in to the [<u>HostByte Game Panel</u>](https://game.hostbyte.net/).
2. Open your **Java** server and click **Stop**.
3. Go to **File Manager** → open `server.properties`.
4. Set:

   ```
   view-distance=8
   simulation-distance=6
   
   ```
5. Click **Save**, then **Start** the server and verify TPS.

### Optional: Per-World Overrides (Paper/Spigot)

- **Paper:** `paper-world-defaults.yml` (global) or `<world>/paper-world.yml` for per-world adjustments.
- **Spigot (older/legacy):** some versions allow per-world tweaks in `spigot.yml` under `world-settings`.

## Suggested Profiles (Copy & Paste)

### Balanced Survival (small SMP)

```
# server.properties
view-distance=8
simulation-distance=6
```

### Performance Under Load (events/peaks)

```
# server.properties
view-distance=6
simulation-distance=4
```

### Creative/Building

```
# server.properties
view-distance=12
simulation-distance=6
```

### Modded / Heavy Redstone

```
# server.properties
view-distance=8
simulation-distance=5
```

## Validate & Tune

1. Join the server at normal peak and run Paper **timings**:

   ```
   /timings on
   # wait 5–10 minutes of real play
   /timings paste
   
   ```
2. If CPU is the bottleneck, lower **simulation-distance** by 1 and re-test. If bandwidth/exploration is heavy, lower **view-distance**.
3. Adjust one value at a time and keep notes.

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **Farms stop working far away:** Simulation too low. Increase by 1 or keep players closer when AFK farming.
- **Players complain they can’t see far:** Raise _view-distance_ gradually; keep simulation conservative for TPS.
- **No change after restart:** Confirm you edited the correct `server.properties`; per-world files may override on Paper.
- **Lag during exploration:** Pre-generate chunks with Chunky and keep _view-distance_ moderate.

## Best Practices

- Favor reducing **simulation-distance** first for CPU relief.
- Pre-generate worlds to eliminate exploration spikes.
- Revisit settings after big player or plugin changes.
- Document final values for staff and future migrations.
