## Step 1: Launch Minecraft Java Edition

1. Open the official **Minecraft Launcher** on your PC or laptop.
2. Log in with your **Microsoft** account.
3. Click **Play** to launch the version your server runs (you can choose a specific version from the launcher).

## Step 2: Find Your Server IP and Port

1. Log in to your [<u>HostByte Game Panel</u>](https://game.hostbyte.net/).
2. Click your Minecraft server to open its details.
3. Locate the **Server Address** (IP and port), e.g. `123.45.67.89:25565`.

**➡️ Note:** If you’re using a custom domain (e.g. `play.yourserver.net`), you can use that instead of the IP.

## Step 3: Add the Server in Minecraft

1. From the main menu, click **Multiplayer**.
2. Click **Add Server**.
3. Enter any **Server Name** you like.
4. Paste your **Server Address** (IP:Port or domain).
5. Click **Done**.

## Step 4: Join Your Server

1. Your server will appear in the list.
2. Select it and click **Join Server**.
3. You should load into your world if the server is online and the version matches.

## ⚠️ Common Connection Issues

### “Can’t Connect to Server”

- Double-check the IP/Port or your custom domain.
- Confirm the server is **Online** in the Game Panel.
- DNS changes can take time—wait up to 30 minutes if you just set a new domain record.

### “Outdated Client” or “Outdated Server”

- Your Minecraft version doesn’t match the server.
- In the Launcher, select the correct version profile and click **Play**.

### “Connection Timed Out”

- Check your internet connection and restart your router if needed.
- Temporarily disable local firewall/antivirus to test (then re-enable).
- Try again later if there’s scheduled maintenance (see status link below).

### “Incompatible Mods”

- Check to make sure the server and client mods are the same.
- Make sure all mods are on the same version.
- In some cases this could happen if you have client side mods installed on the server.

## Security Tips

- Share your IP/domain only with people you trust.
- Use **LuckPerms** and **EssentialsX** to manage ranks and commands safely.
- Keep your server jar and plugins up to date.
