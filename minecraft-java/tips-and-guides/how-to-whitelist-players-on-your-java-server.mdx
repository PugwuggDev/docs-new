title: "How to Whitelist players on your Java Server"
description: "Whitelisting lets you control who can join your Minecraft Java server. This guide shows you how to enable the whitelist, add/remove players, and fix common issues using the HostByte Game Panel."
---

## What is the Whitelist?

The whitelist is an allow-list. When enabled, **only players you add** can join your server. Everyone else will see _“You are not whitelisted on this server!”_

- Works with Vanilla, Paper, Spigot, Forge/Fabric (Java Edition).
- Player entries are stored in `whitelist.json` in your server files.

---

## Step 1: Open Your Server Console

1. Log in to the [<u>HostByte Game Panel</u>](https://game.hostbyte.net/).
2. Click your Java server to open its dashboard.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Console**.

---

## Step 2: Enable the Whitelist (Quick Method)

You can enable the whitelist live with a single console command (no restart required):

```
whitelist on
```

To disable it later:

```
whitelist off
```

---

## Step 3: Add Players to the Whitelist

Add players by their exact Java username. From the **Console** (no slash):

```
whitelist add PlayerName
```

In-game (as an OP) use the slash command:

```
/whitelist add PlayerName
```

### Remove a Player

```
whitelist remove PlayerName
```

### List Whitelisted Players

```
whitelist list
```

### Reload the Whitelist

```
whitelist reload
```

**➡️ Note:** Usernames are resolved to a player’s unique UUID. If a player changes their username, they will _still_ be allowed if originally added successfully.

---

## Step 4 (Optional): Enable via `server.properties`

If you prefer enabling the whitelist through the config file:

1. Click **Files** on the left side of the panel.
2. Edit `server.properties`.
3. Set the line to: `white-list=true`
4. Also set the line to: `enforce-whitelist=true`
5. Click **Save** and **Restart** the server.

**⚠️ Heads-up:** Only use one method at a time. If you enable via file, remember to restart; if you use console commands, you can apply changes immediately and `whitelist reload` as needed.

---

## Step 5 (Advanced): Edit `whitelist.json` Manually

You can add entries directly, but you must use correct UUIDs. We recommend using commands unless you know the player’s UUID.

1. Open **File Manager** → find `whitelist.json`.
2. Use valid JSON entries like:

   ```
   [
     { "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", "name": "PlayerName" }
   ]
   ```
3. Save and run `whitelist reload` in the console.

**⚠️ Heads-up: **You can find your UUID using a website like: https://mcuuid.net/

## Command Quick-Reference

- `whitelist on` — Enable whitelist
- `whitelist off` — Disable whitelist
- `whitelist add <name>` — Add a player
- `whitelist remove <name>` — Remove a player
- `whitelist list` — Show all whitelisted players
- `whitelist reload` — Reload changes without restarting

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### “You are not whitelisted on this server!” (but they are added)

- Run `whitelist reload` to re-scan the list.
- Confirm the username spelling (case-sensitive) on first add.
- Make sure you edited the correct server if you run a network/proxy.
- Restart the server if you changed `server.properties`.

### “Failed to add player / profile not found”

- Ensure the player has a legitimate Java account and correct username.
- Verify your server has internet connectivity (for UUID lookup).
- Try again in a few minutes (rate limits can briefly fail lookups).

### Whitelist appears ineffective

- Verify whitelist is actually on: `whitelist on`.
- If you recently edited files, restart or run `whitelist reload`.
- Keep `online-mode=true` in `server.properties` for secure authentication.

---

## Security Best Practices

- Keep **online-mode** enabled to validate player identities.
- Whitelist your admins and staff too—don’t rely on OP alone.
- Use **LuckPerms** for fine-grained permissions control.
- Back up `server.properties` and `whitelist.json` regularly.
