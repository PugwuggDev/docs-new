# How to Enable/Disable Whitelist

The whitelist system in Minecraft allows only approved players to join your server. This is useful for private communities or testing servers. You can enable or disable the whitelist in a few quick steps using our panel. ✅

---

## 🛠️ Option 1: Using the Panel’s Console

You can turn the whitelist on or off directly through the console:

- ➡️ Open your server's **Console** tab
- ➡️ Type `whitelist on` and press Enter to enable it
- ➡️ Type `whitelist off` to disable it

---

## 🛠️ Option 2: Editing the server.properties File

For a permanent setting:

- ➡️ Go to **File Manager**
- ➡️ Open **server.properties**
- ➡️ Find the line `white-list=false`
- ➡️ Change it to `white-list=true` to enable (or back to `false` to disable)
- ➡️ Save and restart the server

---

## ➕ Adding Players to the Whitelist

Once the whitelist is enabled, only added players can join. To add them:

- ➡️ In the console, type `whitelist add PlayerName`
- ➡️ To remove a player: `whitelist remove PlayerName`

✅ You can also manage the `whitelist.json` file directly in the File Manager if needed.

## ❗ Common Whitelist Issues

- ❌ **“You are not whitelisted”** – Player must be added to the whitelist
- ❌ **Spelling or capitalization error** – Player names must match exactly
- ✅ Make sure the server was restarted after editing `server.properties`
