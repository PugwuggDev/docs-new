## ⚙️ Understanding Server Versions

Different server versions offer different features and capabilities:

- ✅ **Forge** - Modded server with mod support
- ✅ **Fabric** - Lightweight modded server
- ✅ **Bukkit** - Original plugin server (legacy)

### ⚙️ Version Compatibility

**Important Considerations:**

- ✅ **World Compatibility** - Worlds may need conversion
- ✅ **Performance Impact** - Different versions have different performance

1. ➡️ Stop your server completely
2. ➡️ Access File Manager in HostByte panel
3. ➡️ Download your entire server folder
4. ➡️ Store backup in safe location

**⭐ Tip:** This backup will allow you to restore if anything goes wrong.
