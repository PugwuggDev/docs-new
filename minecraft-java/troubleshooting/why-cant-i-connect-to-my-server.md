# Why Can't I Connect to My Server?

Connection issues can prevent you and your players from accessing your Minecraft server. This comprehensive guide will help you diagnose and fix common connection problems, ensuring everyone can join your server successfully. ⚙️

***

### ⚠️ Understanding Connection Issues

Connection problems can occur for various reasons:

* ❌ **Server Status** - Server not running or crashed
* ❌ **Network Issues** - Internet connectivity problems
* ❌ **Firewall Blocking** - Ports blocked by firewall
* ❌ **Incorrect Server Address** - Wrong IP or port
* ❌ **Version Mismatch** - Client/server version differences

#### ⚠️ Common Connection Error Messages

**Typical connection failure messages:**

* ⚠️ **"Connection refused"** - Server not running or port blocked
* ⚠️ **"Connection timed out"** - Network issues or server overload
* ⚠️ **"Cannot resolve hostname"** - DNS or address issues
* ⚠️ **"Outdated server/client"** - Version compatibility problems

***

### ⚙️ Step 1: Check Server Status

First, verify your server is running properly:

#### ⚙️ Server Status Check

1. ➡️ Log into your HostByte control panel
2. ➡️ Check if server is online
3. ➡️ Look for any error messages
4. ➡️ Verify server is accepting connections

#### ⚙️ Console Monitoring

1. ➡️ Open the server console
2. ➡️ Look for startup completion message
3. ➡️ Check for any error messages
4. ➡️ Verify server is listening on correct port

#### ⚙️ Server Health Check

1. ➡️ Check server TPS (should be 20.0)
2. ➡️ Monitor memory usage
3. ➡️ Look for crash reports
4. ➡️ Verify all plugins loaded successfully

***

### ⚙️ Step 2: Verify Server Address

Ensure you're using the correct connection information:

#### ⚙️ IP Address Check

1. ➡️ Get your server IP from HostByte panel
2. ➡️ Verify the IP address is correct
3. ➡️ Check if using IPv4 or IPv6
4. ➡️ Test with different IP formats

#### ⚙️ Port Verification

1. ➡️ Check default port (25565)
2. ➡️ Verify custom port if used
3. ➡️ Test port connectivity
4. ➡️ Check for port conflicts

#### ⚙️ Connection String Format

1. ➡️ Use format: `server-ip:port`
2. ➡️ Example: `192.168.1.100:25565`
3. ➡️ Omit port if using default (25565)
4. ➡️ Test with and without port

***

### ⚙️ Step 3: Check Network Connectivity

Test network connectivity to your server:

#### ⚙️ Ping Test

1. ➡️ Open command prompt/terminal
2. ➡️ Type: `ping your-server-ip`
3. ➡️ Check if ping is successful
4. ➡️ Note response times

#### ⚙️ Port Test

1. ➡️ Use online port checker
2. ➡️ Test port 25565 (or custom port)
3. ➡️ Verify port is open
4. ➡️ Check for firewall blocking

#### ⚙️ Traceroute

1. ➡️ Use `traceroute your-server-ip`
2. ➡️ Identify network bottlenecks
3. ➡️ Check for routing issues
4. ➡️ Contact ISP if needed

***

### ⚙️ Step 4: Check Firewall and Security

Verify firewall settings aren't blocking connections:

#### ⚙️ Local Firewall

1. ➡️ Check Windows Firewall settings
2. ➡️ Allow Minecraft through firewall
3. ➡️ Add exception for server port
4. ➡️ Test with firewall disabled temporarily

#### ⚙️ Router Settings

1. ➡️ Check router firewall settings
2. ➡️ Verify port forwarding (if applicable)
3. ➡️ Check for parental controls
4. ➡️ Test with different network

#### ⚙️ Antivirus Software

1. ➡️ Check antivirus firewall settings
2. ➡️ Add Minecraft to exceptions
3. ➡️ Temporarily disable antivirus
4. ➡️ Test connection
