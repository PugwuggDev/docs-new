## ⛏️ 1. Get Your Server IP and Port

- ➡️ Log into your game panel and select your GMod server
- ➡️ Look for the **IP address** and **port** on the server dashboard

✔️ Example: `123.45.67.89:27015`

## ➕ 2. Use Direct Connect in GMod

- ➡️ Launch Garry’s Mod
- ➡️ Press `~` (tilde) to open the console
- ➡️ Type: `connect your.ip.goes.here:27015` and press Enter

✔️ This is the fastest way to join private servers or those not listed publicly.

## ➖ 3. Add to Favorites in Steam Server Browser

- ➡️ Open Steam
- ➡️ Go to **View \> Servers**
- ➡️ Click the **Favorites** tab
- ➡️ Click **Add a Server** and enter your server IP and port
- ➡️ Once added, right-click the entry and choose **Connect**

✔️ You can keep your server saved here for quick access anytime. ⏰

## ⚠️ Common Connection Issues

- ❌ Make sure your server is running and not password-protected (unless you gave out the password)
- ❌ If your IP changes often, consider using a static IP or domain
- ✔️ Ensure required content (like CS:S or workshop addons) is installed to avoid errors
