## ⛏️ What Are Player Slots?

Player slots determine how many players can join your server at once.

- ➡️ A 10-slot server allows 10 players to connect simultaneously
- ➡️ Slot count is usually adjustable based on your hosting plan

✔️ Some hosts allow you to set your slot number manually, while others lock it based on your package.

## ➕ More Players = More Resources

The more players your server supports, the more CPU and RAM it will use. Other factors also affect performance:

- ➡️ Large or complex maps
- ➡️ Game modes like TTT, DarkRP, or heavily scripted gamemodes
- ➡️ Addons and Workshop content

❗ If your server lags with more players, you may need to upgrade your plan or optimize your content.

## ➖ Minimum Requirements (General Guide)

- ✔️ 2–4 players: 2 GB RAM, minimal CPU usage (Sandbox or basic TTT)
- ✔️ 8–16 players: 3–4 GB RAM, better CPU recommended
- ✔️ 20+ players or DarkRP: 5–8 GB RAM+, strong single-threaded CPU

✔️ These are general estimates — actual usage depends heavily on your setup.

## ⚔️ Recommended Tips

- ➡️ Don’t overload your server with unnecessary addons
- ➡️ Regularly restart to clear up memory leaks
- ➡️ Monitor performance via your panel’s resource stats
