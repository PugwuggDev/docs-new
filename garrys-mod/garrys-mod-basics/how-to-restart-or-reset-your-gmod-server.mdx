## ⛏️ 1. Restarting Your Server

Restarting helps apply configuration changes and clear temporary memory buildup. Restart your server if you:

- ➡️ Installed or removed addons
- ➡️ Switched maps or game modes
- ➡️ Are experiencing lag from long uptime

✔️ To restart your server:

- ➡️ Log into your panel
- ➡️ Click the **Restart** button on the server dashboard
- ✔️ Wait for the console to confirm that the server has fully booted

## ⏰ 2. How to Back Up Your Server (Before Resetting)

If you’re planning to reset or make major changes, it’s critical to create a backup first.

- ➡️ Stop your server before creating a backup
- ➡️ Go to the **Management** section in your panel
- ➡️ Click **Backups**
- ➡️ Click **Create Backup** and wait for the process to complete

✔️ This saves your current files (including addons, maps, configs, and more) so you can restore them later if needed.

❗ Backups are essential — resetting will permanently delete all server data.

## ➖ 3. Resetting (Wiping) Your Server

Resetting wipes all server files and reinstalls Garry’s Mod from scratch. Use this if:

- ➡️ You're switching to a new game mode
- ➡️ You want to clean up broken or outdated files
- ➡️ You’re starting a brand-new server setup

✔️ To reset your server:

- ➡️ Stop your server from the dashboard
- ➡️ Navigate to the **Management** section
- ➡️ Select **Reinstall Server** or **Reset Files**
- ➡️ Confirm the reset and wait for the process to complete
