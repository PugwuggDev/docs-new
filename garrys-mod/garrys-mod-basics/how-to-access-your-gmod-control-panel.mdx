- ➡️ Enter your login credentials
- ➡️ Click your GMod server from the list to open the dashboard

✔️ You’ll now see all available management tools for your server.

The control panel gives you access to key server tools:

- Start, Stop, and Restart your server
- Use the Console to enter commands and check logs
- Upload or edit files via File Manager
- Change game modes, install maps or addons, and more

✔️ Some panels also include a task scheduler, subuser controls, or one-click Workshop support.

## ❗ Troubleshooting Login Problems
