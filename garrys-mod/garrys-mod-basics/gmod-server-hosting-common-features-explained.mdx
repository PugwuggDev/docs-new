## ⛏️ Game Panel Access

Your control panel is the central place for managing your server. It typically includes:

- ➡️ Start, Stop, and Restart controls
- ➡️ File Manager for uploading and editing server files
- ➡️ Console access to monitor logs and run commands
- ➡️ Server version or mod selection (e.g., TTT, DarkRP)

✔️ Some panels also offer advanced tools like scheduled tasks or mod installers.

## ➕ FTP and File Upload

- ➡️ Most hosts provide FTP access so you can upload files using clients like FileZilla
- ➡️ Upload custom maps, addons, Lua scripts, and configuration files

✔️ The File Manager is great for quick changes, but FTP is better for large files.

## ⚔️ Workshop Integration & Addon Support

- ➡️ Easily install Steam Workshop content using collection URLs or manual uploads
- ➡️ Some hosts include automatic Workshop Downloader support

❗ Workshop addons must be properly mounted and configured to work correctly.

## ⏰ FastDL or CDN Support

- ➡️ FastDL (Fast Download) helps clients download required content faster
- ➡️ Some hosts include built-in FastDL or offer CDN support

✔️ This improves loading times for players when joining your server.

## ➖ DDoS Protection and Backups

- ➡️ Most GMod server hosts offer basic DDoS protection to reduce the risk of attacks
- ➡️ Many include automatic or manual server backups

✔️ Always keep recent backups before major changes like installing new addons or changing game modes.
