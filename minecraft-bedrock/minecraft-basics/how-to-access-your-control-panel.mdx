# How to Access Your Control Panel

Your control panel is where you manage your Minecraft Bedrock server — including starting/stopping the server, editing files, uploading addons, and more. ✔️ This guide will show you how to log in and get started using either Multicraft or Pterodactyl panels.

### ⛏️ Step 1: Check Your Welcome Email

* ➡️ When you first order a server, you’ll receive a welcome email with login info
* ✔️ This includes your panel URL, username, and temporary password

Can’t find it? Search your inbox for “Welcome” or check your client area under active services.

### ⏰ Step 2: Log Into the Panel

Open the panel link in your browser and enter your login details.

* ✔️ If your panel uses **Multicraft**, you’ll see the Multicraft logo and navigation bar on the left
* ✔️ If it’s **Pterodactyl**, the layout will include tabs like Console, File Manager, Users, etc.

➡️ Both panels give you access to core features like console, file editing, and server controls.

### ⚔️ What You Can Do in the Panel

* ✔️ Start, stop, or restart your Bedrock server
* ✔️ View the live console and send commands
* ✔️ Edit configuration files like `server.properties`
* ✔️ Upload addons, behavior packs, or custom worlds
* ✔️ Create and manage server backups

➡️ You’ll also see your server’s resource usage, player list, and log files.
