# How to Connect to Your Minecraft Bedrock Server

To join your Minecraft Bedrock server, you’ll need your server’s IP address and port. This guide will show you how to connect from any Bedrock-supported device, including Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and mobile. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ Step 1: Locate Your Server IP and Port

➡️ Log into your control panel and select your Bedrock server.

* ✔️ The IP address and port will be shown on the server dashboard
* ✔️ Default Bedrock port is usually `19132`, but check your panel to confirm

***

### Step 2: Add the Server to Minecraft

On your Bedrock device (Windows, mobile, Xbox, etc.):

* ➡️ Open Minecraft Bedrock Edition
* ➡️ Go to **Play > Servers**
* ➡️ Scroll down and tap **Add Server**
* ✔️ Enter a name (any name is fine)
* ✔️ Enter your server’s IP address and port
* ➡️ Tap **Save** or **Play** to connect

***

### Notes for Console Players

Console platforms like Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch do not allow adding external servers by default.

To connect on consoles:

* ✔️ Use the Windows 10 or mobile version to connect instead
* ✔️ Or use a DNS redirect method or third-party tools (not officially supported)

➡️ Microsoft’s restrictions limit direct server entry on consoles.

### ❌ Connection Failed?

If you can’t connect, check the following:

* ❌ Make sure the IP and port are correct
* ❌ Ensure the server is started and online
* ❌ Confirm you’re using Bedrock Edition (Java won’t connect to Bedrock servers)
