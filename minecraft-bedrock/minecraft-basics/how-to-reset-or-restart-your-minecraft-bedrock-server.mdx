# How to Reset or Restart Your Minecraft Bedrock Server

Whether you want to restart your Bedrock server to apply changes or completely reset it with a fresh world, this guide will show you how to do both safely and correctly. ✔️

***

### ⏰ Restarting the Server (Soft Reset)

A restart simply shuts down the server and boots it back up. This is useful after:

* ✔️ Changing configuration files
* ✔️ Uploading new addons or packs
* ✔️ Experiencing lag or performance drops

➡️ To restart:

* ➡️ Log into your game panel
* ➡️ Select your server and click the **Restart** button

This won’t delete any files or change your world. It’s safe to use any time. ✅

### ⚠️ Resetting the Server (Full World Reset)

Resetting your server will delete your current world and generate a new one. Do this if you want to start over completely.

➡️ Steps to reset your Bedrock server:

1. Stop the server from the panel
2. Go to the File Manager
3. Delete the `worlds` folder (this contains your saved world data)
4. Start the server again — a new world will be generated automatically

✔️ You can also upload your own world if desired before starting the server.

### ✅ Backup Before Resetting

Before deleting anything, we recommend creating a backup just in case:

* ➡️ Use the Backup button in your panel (if available)
* ✔️ Download the world folder to your computer for safekeeping

Accidentally deleted the wrong world? A backup can save you from starting over. ✅
