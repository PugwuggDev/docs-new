# What Is a Minecraft Bedrock Server and How Does It Work?

A Minecraft Bedrock server is a multiplayer game server that allows players using the Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and mobile) to play together in a shared world — even when the original host is offline. ✔️

Hosting your own Bedrock server gives you more control over gameplay, settings, and who can join your world. You can install custom addons, invite friends across platforms, and keep your world running 24/7. ✅

### ⏰ Key Differences from Java Servers

While similar in concept, Bedrock and Java servers are not compatible with each other. Here are some key differences:

* ➕ Addons and behavior packs instead of Java mods
* ➕ Cross-platform multiplayer is built-in
* ✔️ Bedrock servers use a different software structure and file system

➡️ If you're playing on console or mobile, a Bedrock server is the way to go.
