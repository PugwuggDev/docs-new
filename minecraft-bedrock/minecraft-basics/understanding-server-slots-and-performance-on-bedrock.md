# Understanding Server Slots and Performance on Bedrock

When setting up your Minecraft Bedrock server, you’ll need to choose the number of player slots and understand how performance is affected by things like RAM, CPU, and world settings. This guide explains how slots work and how to ensure smooth gameplay. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ What Are Player Slots?

Player slots determine how many people can be connected to your Bedrock server at the same time. For example:

* ✔️ 5 slots = up to 5 online players
* ✔️ 20 slots = up to 20 online players

➡️ You can set this in your panel or server configuration depending on your plan. More slots may require additional resources.

### ➕ How Slots Affect Performance

The number of slots doesn’t directly impact performance, but more players means more server activity:

* ✔️ More world chunks loaded
* ✔️ More mobs/entities spawned
* ✔️ More commands and plugins running

This increases CPU and RAM usage, especially with addons or custom behavior packs.

### ⚠️ Choosing the Right Slot Count

We recommend picking a plan based on expected usage:

* ✔️ 1–5 players → Basic plan (ideal for friends/family)
* ✔️ 10–20 players → Medium-tier plan with more RAM
* ✔️ 20+ players → High-performance plan with upgraded CPU

➡️ You can always upgrade later if needed.

### ⏰ Tips for Better Performance

* ✔️ Lower the view distance in `server.properties`
* ✔️ Limit unnecessary addons or scripts
* ✔️ Use regular restarts and backups

Keeping your server clean and optimized helps ensure the best performance — no matter how many players are online. ✅
