# Creating Subusers for Bedrock Server Management

If you're managing your Minecraft Bedrock server with friends or a team, you can create **subusers** to give them access to the control panel — without sharing your main account credentials. ✅

***

### ⛏️ 1. What Are Subusers?

* ✔️ Subusers are additional accounts that can access your server through the panel
* ✔️ You can assign specific permissions, like access to the console, file manager, or scheduler
* ✔️ Useful for co-owners, admins, developers, or moderators

***

### ➕ 2. How to Add a Subuser

* ➡️ Log into your control panel and go to your server’s dashboard
* ➡️ Find and click on the **Subusers** or **Users** tab
* ➡️ Click **Add User** or **Create Subuser**
* ➡️ Enter the user’s email address (they will receive an invite)

✔️ The invited user will need to create a panel account if they don’t already have one.

***

### ⏰ 3. Assign Permissions Carefully

* ➡️ Choose which permissions the subuser should have (e.g., Start/Stop Server, File Manager, Console)
* ➡️ Avoid giving full access unless the person is trusted

⚠️ Be cautious when granting access to file management or backups, as changes there can affect your entire server.

***

### ➖ 4. Managing or Removing Subusers

* ➡️ You can edit or remove subusers at any time from the same panel area
* ✔️ This ensures you stay in full control of who can access your server
