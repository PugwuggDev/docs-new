# Using the Console to Run Bedrock Server Commands

The console is a powerful tool that lets you manage your Bedrock server directly — even if you’re not logged into the game. You can use it to run commands like `op`, `kick`, `whitelist`, and more. ✅

***

### ⛏️ 1. Open the Console in Your Game Panel

* ➡️ Log into your game panel and select your Bedrock server
* ➡️ Click the **Console** tab to open the live command interface

✔️ This window shows live logs and allows you to enter commands in real time.

***

### ➕ 2. Common Server Commands

Here are a few commands you might use often:

* `op PlayerName` – Grants admin (operator) access
* `deop PlayerName` – Removes operator permissions
* `whitelist add PlayerName` – Adds a player to the whitelist
* `whitelist remove PlayerName` – Removes a player from the whitelist
* `kick PlayerName` – Disconnects a player from the server
* `ban PlayerName` – Bans a player

✔️ Replace `PlayerName` with the exact in-game username.

### ⚔️ 3. Troubleshooting Tips

* ➡️ If a command doesn't work, double-check spelling and capitalization
* ➡️ Some commands require operator permissions or specific server types (e.g., PocketMine)
* ✔️ You can also check the console for syntax errors or permission issues
