# Uploading Files via File Manager or FTP (Bedrock)

Whether you're adding custom worlds, uploading behavior packs, or editing config files, there are two ways to upload files to your Minecraft Bedrock server: through the built-in File Manager or using an external FTP client. ✅

***

### ⛏️ 1. Using the File Manager

* ➡️ Log into your game panel and select your server
* ➡️ Navigate to the **File Manager** section
* ➡️ Use the **Upload** button to add individual files

✔️ You can drag and drop multiple files, but large folders or .zip files may take longer to upload.

***

### ➕ 2. Uploading Folders or ZIP Files

* ➡️ For complete addons or world folders, first compress them into a `.zip` file
* ➡️ Upload the `.zip` file via the File Manager
* ➡️ Right-click and select **Unzip** once the file appears in your directory

✔️ This is the easiest method for uploading structured folders like `behavior_packs` or `resource_packs`.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Uploading with an FTP Client (Advanced)

* ➡️ Open your FTP client (like FileZilla or WinSCP)
* ➡️ Use the FTP login details from your control panel (host, username, password, port)
* ➡️ Navigate to the correct directory and drag your files in

✔️ FTP is recommended for large uploads or batch changes. Be sure to stop your server while making major changes.

***

### ⏰ 4. Where to Upload Common Files

* `worlds/` – Custom world folders
* `behavior_packs/` – Addons that affect gameplay
* `resource_packs/` – Addons that change textures or UI
* `plugins/` – Only for PocketMine or Nukkit servers

✔️ Always restart your server after uploading new content to apply the changes.
