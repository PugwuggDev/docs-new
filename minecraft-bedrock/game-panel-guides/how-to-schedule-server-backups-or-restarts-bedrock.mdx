# How to Schedule Server Backups or Restarts (Bedrock)

Automating server restarts or backups is a great way to improve performance and protect your Minecraft Bedrock server’s data. Most panels allow you to schedule these tasks using a built-in scheduler. ✅

***

### ⛏️ 1. Why Schedule Backups and Restarts?

* ✔️ Regular restarts help clear memory and reduce lag
* ✔️ Backups protect your world in case of crashes or file corruption
* ✔️ Automating both saves time and keeps your server running smoothly

***

### ➕ 2. Access the Scheduler

* ➡️ Log into your control panel
* ➡️ Select your server, then go to **Schedules** or **Tasks**
* ➡️ Click **Create Schedule** or **Add Task**

✔️ If you don’t see the scheduler option, check with your host to ensure it's enabled for your account.

***

### ⏰ 3. Schedule a Server Restart

* ➡️ Set the time and frequency (daily, every X hours, etc.)
* ➡️ Choose the action: **Restart Server**
* ➡️ Save the task

✔️ Many server owners restart nightly to avoid performance drops during the day.

### ⚔️ 4. Schedule a Server Backup

* ➡️ Create a new task and choose the action: **Backup Files** or **Run Backup**
* ➡️ Select which files or directories to include (e.g. `worlds/`)
* ➡️ Set the backup frequency and time

✔️ Make sure to monitor storage usage — frequent backups can add up quickly.
