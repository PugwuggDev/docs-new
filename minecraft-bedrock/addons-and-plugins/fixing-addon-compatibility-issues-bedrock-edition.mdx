# Fixing Addon Compatibility Issues (Bedrock Edition)

If your Minecraft Bedrock server crashes or fails to load correctly after installing an addon, it's likely a compatibility issue. This guide covers the most common addon-related problems and how to fix them. ⚠️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Check the Manifest File

Each behavior or resource pack must include a `manifest.json` file with the correct structure:

* ✔️ UUIDs for the pack and modules
* ✔️ Version format (e.g. `[1, 0, 0]`)
* ✔️ Proper JSON syntax (no trailing commas or typos)

❌ If the server console shows a manifest error, open the file and fix formatting issues using a JSON validator.

***

### ➕ 2. Confirm Compatibility with Bedrock Version

Make sure the addon was made for the same version your server is running:

* ✔️ Older packs may break on newer versions
* ✔️ Update the pack or find a newer version from the creator

➡️ You can view your server’s Bedrock version in the panel under Configuration or on the server dashboard.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Verify Pack Activation in JSON Files

Behavior and resource packs must be registered in the correct files:

* ➡️ `world_behavior_packs.json`
* ➡️ `world_resource_packs.json`

Each entry should match the UUID and version listed in the addon’s `manifest.json`. A missing or incorrect UUID will prevent the pack from loading. ❗

***

### ⏰ 4. Restart the Server After Changes

Always restart the server after uploading or modifying addons. Changes won’t take effect until the server reloads the world and its pack data. ✅
