# Adding Custom Behavior Packs or Resource Packs

Want to customize your Bedrock server’s gameplay or visuals? You can upload your own **behavior packs** (for features) and **resource packs** (for textures, UI, sounds, etc.). This guide explains how to install and activate them properly. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ Step 1: Download or Create the Pack

* ➡️ Packs must be for **Bedrock Edition** and typically come in `.mcpack` or `.zip` format
* ➡️ You can find community-made packs at sites like [mcpedl.com](https://mcpedl.com/)
* ✔️ Make sure the pack includes a valid `manifest.json` file

***

### ➕ Step 2: Upload the Pack to Your Server

* ➡️ Log into your panel and open the **File Manager**
* ➡️ Navigate to one of the following folders:
  * `behavior_packs` – for behavior packs
  * `resource_packs` – for resource packs
* ➡️ Upload the pack folder or contents

✔️ If using a `.zip` file, extract it before uploading. Only upload the internal folder containing the `manifest.json`.

***

### ⚔️ Step 3: Activate the Pack in Your World

To apply a pack to your world:

* ➡️ Go to your `worlds` folder and open your active world folder
* ➡️ Edit the `world_behavior_packs.json` or `world_resource_packs.json` file
* ✔️ Add the UUID and version from the pack’s `manifest.json`

This tells the server to load the pack at startup. ✅

***

### ⏰ Step 4: Restart Your Server

Once you’ve uploaded and configured the pack, restart your server for the changes to take effect.
