# Installing Plugins on Bedrock Using PocketMine or Nukkit

To use plugins on a Minecraft Bedrock server, you'll need to switch from the default Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS) to a plugin-compatible version like **PocketMine-MP** or **Nukkit**. ✔️ These platforms support custom plugins, giving you more control over gameplay and server features.

***

### ⛏️ Step 1: Choose PocketMine or Nukkit

Here’s a quick comparison:

* ✔️ **PocketMine-MP** – More widely used, larger plugin library
* ✔️ **Nukkit** – Better performance in some cases, fewer plugins available

➡️ Both are great for adding features like warps, permissions, economy systems, and minigames.

***

### ⚙️ Step 2: Change Server Version

To install one of these platforms:

* ➡️ Go to your panel’s **Configuration** or **Advanced** section
* ➡️ Select the **PocketMine** or **Nukkit** version
* ➡️ Save and restart your server

✔️ This will install the correct base files and prepare your server for plugin support.

***

### ➕ Step 3: Upload Plugins

Once switched to PocketMine or Nukkit:

* ➡️ Go to the **File Manager** in your panel
* ➡️ Open the `plugins` folder
* ➡️ Upload your plugin `.phar` or `.jar` files

✔️ Make sure the plugin is made for the platform you're using (PMMP or Nukkit — they are not cross-compatible).

### ⏰ Step 4: Restart the Server

After uploading plugins, restart the server to activate them. ✅

➡️ You can then use the in-game console or server console to verify plugin installation.
