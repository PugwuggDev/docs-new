# How to Install Addons on a Minecraft Bedrock Server

Addons are the main way to customize Minecraft Bedrock servers. They include **behavior packs** (which change game logic) and **resource packs** (which modify textures, sounds, etc.). This guide shows how to install them on your Bedrock server. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ Step 1: Find Compatible Addons

Addons usually come in `.mcpack` or `.zip` format. You can find them on sites like:

* ➡️ [MCPE DL](https://mcpedl.com/)
* ➡️ CurseForge Bedrock section
* ➡️ Other trusted Minecraft addon communities

✔️ Make sure the addon is designed for Bedrock Edition, not Java.

***

### ⚔️ Step 2: Upload the Addon Files

Once downloaded, upload the files to your server:

* ➡️ Log into your game panel
* ➡️ Open the File Manager
* ➡️ Navigate to the `behavior_packs` or `resource_packs` folder
* ➡️ Upload the `.mcpack` or extracted folder contents here

✔️ You may need to extract `.zip` files before uploading.

***

### ➕ Step 3: Enable the Addon in `world_behavior_packs.json` or `world_resource_packs.json`

To activate the addon, you’ll need to register it in the world’s pack configuration file:

* ➡️ Open the `worlds` folder, then the folder for your active world
* ➡️ Edit `world_behavior_packs.json` or `world_resource_packs.json`
* ✔️ Insert the addon’s UUID and version (usually listed in the addon’s `manifest.json`)

❗ This step is necessary for the server to load the addon correctly.

### ⏰ Step 4: Restart the Server

After uploading and configuring the addon, restart your server from the panel to apply changes. ✅
