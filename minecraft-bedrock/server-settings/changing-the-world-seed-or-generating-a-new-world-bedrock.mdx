# Changing the World Seed or Generating a New World (Bedrock)

Want to start fresh or use a specific Minecraft world seed on your Bedrock server? This guide will walk you through how to reset your world or set a custom seed for new world generation. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ What Is a World Seed?

A seed is a number or text string that determines how Minecraft generates your world. Using the same seed will always generate the same terrain layout. ➡️ This is useful if you want specific biomes, structures, or a popular world layout.

***

### ➕ How to Set a Custom Seed

* ➡️ Log into your control panel and open the **File Manager**
* ➡️ Open `server.properties`
* ➡️ Find the line `level-seed=`
* ➡️ Enter your desired seed (number or text)
* ✔️ Save the file

❗ The new seed will only apply the next time a new world is generated.

### ⏰ How to Generate a New World

If you want to start a fresh world (with or without a new seed):

1. ➡️ Stop your server
2. ➡️ In the File Manager, delete the `worlds` folder
3. ➡️ If you added a new seed, make sure it’s saved in `server.properties`
4. ➡️ Start the server again — it will generate a new world automatically

✔️ If no seed is defined, a random one will be used.
