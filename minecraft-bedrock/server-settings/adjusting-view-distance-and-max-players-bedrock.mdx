# Adjusting View Distance and Max Players (Bedrock)

Fine-tuning your Bedrock server’s performance can make a big difference in player experience. This guide covers how to change the **view distance** and **maximum player limit** through the `server.properties` file. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ What Is View Distance?

**View distance** controls how many chunks are loaded around each player. A lower number improves performance but reduces how far players can see.

* `view-distance=10` (default)
* ➡️ Lower = less lag, especially with multiple players
* ✔️ Ideal range: 6–10 for most servers

❗ High view distance on low-memory plans can cause lag.

***

### ➕ How to Change View Distance

* ➡️ Log into your panel and open the **File Manager**
* ➡️ Open `server.properties`
* ➡️ Find `view-distance=` and enter a new value
* ➡️ Save the file and restart the server

✔️ The new view distance will apply after restart.

***

### ⏰ Changing the Max Player Limit

* ➡️ In `server.properties`, locate `max-players=10`
* ➡️ Change it to the number of players you want to allow
* ✔️ Example: `max-players=20` for a 20-player server
* ➡️ Save and restart your server

⚠️ Keep this number realistic for your hosting plan’s resources.
