# Editing the server.properties File on Bedrock

The `server.properties` file controls key settings for your Minecraft Bedrock server, such as game mode, difficulty, world name, PvP, and more. This guide shows you how to safely edit those values through your control panel. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ Step 1: Open the File Manager

* ➡️ Log into your game panel
* ➡️ Select your Bedrock server
* ➡️ Go to the **File Manager**
* ➡️ Find and click on `server.properties`

✔️ This file uses simple key-value pairs (e.g. `gamemode=survival`).

***

### ➕ Common Settings You Can Edit

Here are some of the most useful options you may want to change:

* `gamemode=survival` ➡️ Change to `creative` or `adventure`
* `difficulty=easy` ➡️ Set to `peaceful`, `normal`, or `hard`
* `pvp=true` ➡️ Set to `false` to disable player-vs-player combat
* `max-players=10` ➡️ Increase or reduce the max player count
* `level-name=BedrockLevel` ➡️ Rename your world folder

✔️ Make sure you enter valid values — spelling matters!

***

### ⏰ Step 2: Save and Restart

* ➡️ After making your changes, click **Save**
* ➡️ Restart the server to apply the new settings

Changes to `server.properties` won’t take effect until the server restarts. ✅
