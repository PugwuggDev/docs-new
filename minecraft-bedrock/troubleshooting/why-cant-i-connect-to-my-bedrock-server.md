# Why Can’t I Connect to My Bedrock Server?

If you're having trouble connecting to your Minecraft Bedrock server, there could be several causes — from incorrect IP settings to firewall issues. This guide will help you troubleshoot the most common problems. ⚠️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Check the IP and Port

* ➡️ Make sure you're using the correct **IP address** and **Bedrock port** (usually `19132`)
* ✔️ These details are shown on your server’s dashboard in the panel

❌ Java Edition players cannot connect to Bedrock servers and vice versa.

***

### ➕ 2. Confirm the Server Is Online

* ➡️ Check your panel to see if the server is **running**
* ➡️ If it's stopped or crashed, try starting it again
* ✔️ You can also check the console for errors

⏰ If the server crashes during startup, it could be due to addon issues or missing files.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Make Sure You're on the Right Version

* ➡️ Your Bedrock client version must match or be compatible with the server version
* ✔️ If you're getting a "server outdated" message, the server may need to be updated

➡️ See our guide on **Fixing “Server Outdated” or “Incompatible Version” Errors** for more help.

### ➖ 4. Double-Check Your Internet and NAT Type

* ➡️ Restart your router and game if you suspect a local connection issue
* ➡️ Strict NAT types or certain firewall/router settings can block server connections

✔️ Try connecting from another device or network to rule out local issues.
