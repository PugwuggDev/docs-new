# Fixing “Server Outdated” or “Incompatible Version” Errors (Bedrock)

If you see a “Server Outdated” or “Incompatible Version” error when trying to connect to your Bedrock server, it usually means there’s a mismatch between your client and server versions. Follow these steps to fix the problem. ⚠️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Confirm Your Server Version

➡️ Check the version of your server by logging into your control panel. The version should be displayed on the main dashboard.

✔️ Make sure it matches the version of your Minecraft Bedrock client. If it’s outdated, you will need to update your server.

### ➕ 2. Update Your Server

If your server is running an older version of Minecraft Bedrock, updating it can often fix compatibility errors.

* ➡️ Go to your control panel and navigate to the **Settings** section.
* ➡️ Under **Server Version**, select the latest supported version of Bedrock.
* ➡️ Click **Save** and restart your server to apply the update.

❗ Keep in mind that if you’re using custom plugins or mods, updating your server may require you to update those as well.

### ⚔️ 3. Ensure You Are Using a Compatible Client Version

Your Minecraft Bedrock client version must match the server version. If you’re unable to update the server, you may need to update your client to a compatible version.

* ➡️ On the Minecraft Bedrock client, go to your app store (Google Play, Microsoft Store, etc.)
* ➡️ Check for any updates and install the latest version if available.

✔️ Once both versions are aligned, try connecting to the server again.

### ⏰ 4. Use the Correct Server Address

Sometimes a version mismatch happens when the wrong server address is entered. Make sure you’re connecting to the correct server IP and port.

* ➡️ Double-check that the IP is accurate, and that the port is set to the default (`19132`) unless you’ve configured it differently.
