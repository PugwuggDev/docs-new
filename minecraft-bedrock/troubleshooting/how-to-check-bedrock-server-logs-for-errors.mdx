# How to Check Bedrock Server Logs for Errors

If your Bedrock server isn’t working correctly — whether it's crashing, lagging, or refusing to start — checking the server logs is the first step in identifying the cause. Here's how to find and read those logs. ✔️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Access the Console Log

* ➡️ Log into your control panel
* ➡️ Select your server and click on the **Console** tab
* ➡️ The live console shows real-time events as the server boots and runs

✔️ Look for red or yellow lines — these usually indicate warnings or errors.

***

### ➕ 2. Review the Latest.log File (If Available)

* ➡️ Open the **File Manager**
* ➡️ Look for a file named `logs/latest.log` or similar (not all Bedrock builds generate it)
* ➡️ Download or open it to review full startup history

⚠️ This can contain more detail than the live console alone.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Common Log Error Types

* ❌ **Addon or Pack Errors** – Often related to invalid `manifest.json` or missing files
* ❌ **File Not Found** – A required file was deleted or renamed
* ❌ **JSON Parsing** – Incorrect formatting in config files like `permissions.json`

➡️ Match the error to recent changes (new packs, edits, etc.) to find the cause quickly.

***

### ⏰ 4. Use a JSON Validator

If the error relates to a JSON file, copy the contents and use a free online **JSON validator** to find and fix formatting mistakes.

✔️ Even a missing comma or extra bracket can crash your server.
