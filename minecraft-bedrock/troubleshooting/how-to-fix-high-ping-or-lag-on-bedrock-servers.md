# How to Fix High Ping or Lag on Bedrock Servers

Experiencing lag or high ping on your Minecraft Bedrock server? These issues can come from server settings, internet connection quality, or addon/plugin conflicts. Here’s how to troubleshoot and reduce lag for smoother gameplay. ⚠️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Check Your Internet and NAT Type

* ➡️ Use a wired connection for more stability
* ➡️ Restart your router and check your ping to the server
* ➡️ NAT Type "Strict" can prevent reliable Bedrock connections

✔️ Players connecting from far regions may also experience higher latency.

***

### ➕ 2. Reduce View Distance

* ➡️ Open `server.properties` in the File Manager
* ➡️ Find `view-distance=` and lower the number (e.g. from 10 to 6)
* ➡️ Save and restart the server

✔️ A smaller view distance reduces chunk loading and improves performance for all players.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Remove Lag-Causing Addons or Plugins

* ➡️ Some poorly optimized addons or plugins can cause major lag
* ➡️ Remove any recently added behavior packs, resource packs, or plugins and restart

❌ Lag often appears after installing outdated or incompatible files.

***

### ⏰ 4. Limit Redstone or Mob Farms

* ➡️ Excessive mob spawns, redstone clocks, or large contraptions can cause server strain
* ✔️ Consider using addons that limit mob counts or optimize redstone behavior

✔️ Large farms are common culprits in survival servers with frequent lag spikes.

***

### ➖ 5. Monitor Player Count and Performance

* ➡️ Reduce the `max-players` value if your server is overloaded
* ➡️ Watch for performance dips when many players are online at once

✔️ Upgrading your hosting plan can help if you're consistently hitting your limits.
