# Bedrock Server Won’t Start: Common Causes and Fixes

If your Minecraft Bedrock server fails to start or stops immediately after launching, there may be an issue with your configuration, files, or installed addons. This guide will help you identify and fix the most common causes. ⚠️

***

### ⛏️ 1. Check the Console for Errors

* ➡️ Open your game panel and go to the **Console**
* ➡️ Look for any red error messages or warnings
* ✔️ Common errors include missing files, permission issues, or syntax problems

❌ If the console stops immediately after startup, something is likely breaking during initialization.

***

### ➕ 2. Review Your Addons or Plugins

* ➡️ Recently installed a new addon or plugin? It might be incompatible with your current Bedrock version
* ➡️ Try removing or disabling the most recent files from the `behavior_packs`, `resource_packs`, or `plugins` folder

✔️ Restart the server after each change to test which file is causing the issue.

***

### ⚔️ 3. Make Sure Required Files Are Present

* ➡️ Check that all required server files are in place — especially `server.properties` and `permissions.json`
* ➡️ If you’ve deleted key files accidentally, reinstalling the Bedrock version from your panel may help

***

### ➖ 4. Verify the Server Version

* ➡️ Go to the **Configuration** or **Advanced** section in your panel
* ➡️ Make sure you’ve selected a supported and properly installed version

❗ An incorrect or corrupt version install may cause the server to crash during boot.

***

### ⏰ 5. Check for Incorrect File Edits

* ➡️ If you've recently edited `server.properties`, `permissions.json`, or any JSON config files, double-check for formatting mistakes
* ✔️ Use a JSON validator to verify syntax and structure
